# MTH 320: Analysis I (Spring 2019)

This repository contains my personal study materials and exercise solutions for **Analysis I**, primarily based on Stephen Abbott's *Understanding Analysis*.

## 📖 Project Overview
Analysis I (Real Analysis) serves as the foundation for rigorous mathematical study. This project follows the curriculum of **MTH 320 (Spring 2019)** taught by **Prof. Matthew Cha**, while also utilizing well-crafted notes by **Prof. Baisheng Yan**.

The goal of this repository is to:
* Develop proof-writing skills using axioms, definitions, and theorems.
* Provide a centralized navigation tool for course materials.
* Share exercise write-ups and expository content on real analysis topics.
