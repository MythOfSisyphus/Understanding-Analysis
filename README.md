**Reference Book:** Understanding Analysis, 2*nd* Edition 

*Real Analysis* serves as foundation of our rigorous mathematical study, where results seem obvious and fairly intuitive and that's not the case when it comes to prove those results. In this course, we learn how to use axioms, definitions and theorems effectively to prove desired results.

I started this course with Prof. Abbott's book *Understanding Analysis* in hand and while studying I came across well-crafted notes written by Prof. Baisheng Yan based on *Understanding Analysis* for MTH 320 (Spring 2018). Unfortunately, Spring 2018 version of the course isn't available online yet I found Spring 2019 version that was taught by Prof. Matthew Cha and there are many homework assignments, their solutions and exams available for free.

I'm using these resources to learn *Real Analysis*. This page serves as a navigation tool to access materials quickly. I will be working and writing proofs of various exercises given in both book and assignments to get most out of the course and to learn proof-writing skills. If you find any mistake in a proof or much nicer proof of some problem, then feel free to reach out or make a pull request.
