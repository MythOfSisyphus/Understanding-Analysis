**Exercise 1.3.1.** $(a)$ Write a formal definition in the style of Definition 1.3.2 for the *infimum* or *greatest lower bound* of a set.

$(b)$ Now, state and prove a version of Lemma 1.3.8 for greatest lower bounds.

**Definition:** $(a)$ **The infimum of a set:** A real number $l$ is the greatest lower bound for a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if it meets the following two criteria:
1. $l$ is an lower bound for $A$.
2. if $b$ is any lower bound for $A$, then $b \leq l$.

$(b)$ **Infimum version of Lemma 1.3.8.** Assume $l \in \mathbb{R}$ is an lower bound for a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $l = \inf{A}$ if and only if, for every choice of $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an element $a \in A$ satisfying $l + \epsilon > a$.

**Proof:** ($\Rightarrow$) We assume $l = \inf{A}$ and consider $l + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon > 0$ has been arbitrarily chosen. Because $l + \epsilon > l$, part $2$ of Definition $(a)$ implies that $l + \epsilon$ is not a lower bound for $A$. If this is the case, there must be some element $a \in A$ for which $l + \epsilon > a$.

($\Leftarrow$) Conversely, assume $l$ is a lower bound with the property that no matter how $\epsilon > 0$ is chosen, $l + \epsilon$ is no longer a lower bound for $A$. Notice that what this implies is that if $b$ is any number greater than $l$, then $b$ is not a lower bound. To prove that $l = \inf{A}$, we must verify part $2$ of Definition $(a)$. Because we have just argued that any number greater than $l$ cannot be lower bound, it follows that if $b$ is some other lower bound for $A$, then $b \leq l$.

**Exercise 1.3.9.** $(a)$ If $\sup{A} < \sup{B}$, show that there exists an element $b \in B$ that is an upper bound for $A$.

$(b)$ Give an example to show that this is not always the case if we only assume $\sup{A} \leq \sup{B}$.

**Proof:** $(a)$ Suppose $\sup{A} < \sup{B}$. Assume, for contradiction, that every $b \in B$ satisfies $b \leq \sup{A}$. Then $\sup{A}$ is an upper bound for $B$, so by definition of the least upper bound, $\sup{B} \leq \sup{A}$. This contradicts $\sup{A} < \sup{B}$. Therefore, there exists $b \in B$ such that $b > \sup{A}$. Since $\sup{A}$ is an least upper bound for $A$, any number greater than $\sup{A}$ is also an upper bound for $A$. Hence this $b$ is an upper bound for $A$.

$(b)$ Let $A = [1, 5]$ and $B = [4, 5)$. Then $\sup{A} = 5$ and $\sup{B} = 5$, so $\sup{A} \leq \sup{B}$. However, every $b \in B$ satisfied $b < 5$. Since $5$ is the least upper bound for $A$, any upper bound for $A$ must be at least $5$. Hence no element of $B$ can be upper bound for $A$. This shows that the conclusion of part $(a)$ may fail if we only assume $\sup{A} \leq \sup{B}$.

**Exercise 1.3.10 (Cut Property).** The *Cut Property* of the real numbers is the following:

> If $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, disjoint sets with $A \cup B = \mathbb{R}$ and $a < b$ for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, then there exists $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \leq c$ whenever $x \in A$ and $x \geq c$ whenever $x \in B$.

$(a)$ Use the Axiom of Completeness to prove the Cut Property.

$(b)$ Show that the implication goes the other way; that is, assume $\mathbb{R}$ possesses the Cut Property and let $E$ be a nonempty set that is bounded above. Prove $\sup{E}$ exists. 

$(c)$ The punchline of parts $(a)$ and $(b)$ is that the Cut Property could be used in place of the Axiom of Completeness as the fundamental axiom that distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers. To drive this point home, give a concrete example showing that the Cut Property is not a valid statement when $\mathbb{R}$ is replaced by $\mathbb{Q}$.

**Proof:** $(a)$ Notice that for any $b \in B, a < b$ for all $a \in A$. That is every element of $B$ is an upper bound for $A$, by Axiom of Completeness there must exist least upper bound, say, $c = \sup{A}$.
If there exists $b \in B$ with $b < c$ and $b$ is an upper bound for $A$, this contradicts our definition of least upper bound as every upper bound $b$ must be $\geq c$. Therefore, $a \leq c$ for all $a \in A$ and $c \leq b$ for all $b \in B$.

$(b)$ Since $E \not = \emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}$ possesses the Cut Property that is nothing but, $E \cup E^{c} = \mathbb{R}$.

**Exercise 1.3.11.** Decide if the following statements about suprema and infima are true or false. Give a short proof for those that are true. For any that are false, supply an example where the claim in question does not appear to hold. 

$(a)$ If $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, bounded, and satisfy $A \subseteq B$, then $\sup{A} \leq \sup{B}$.

$(b)$ If $\sup{A} < \inf{B}$ for sets $A$ and $B$, then there exists a $c \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $a < c < b$ for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

$(c)$ If there exists a $c \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $a < c < b$ for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, then $\sup{A} < \inf{B}$.

**Proof:** $(a)$ Since $A \subseteq B$, every element of $A$ is in $B$. Because $B$ is bounded above, $\sup{B}$ exists (by Axiom of Completeness) and satisfied $x \leq \sup{B}$ for all $x \in B$. In particular, for each $a \in A$, we have
$a \leq \sup{B}$. Thus $\sup{B}$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since $\sup{A}$ is the least upper bound for $A$, it follows that $\sup{A} \leq \sup{B}$.

$(b)$ Assume $\sup{A} < \inf{B}$. By the density of $\mathbb{R}$, there exists a real number $c$ such that $\sup{A} < c < \inf{B}$ (for instance, $c = \frac{\sup{A} + \inf{B}}{2})$. Now, for any $a \in A$, we have $a \leq \sup{A} < c,$ so $a < c$. For any $b \in B$, we have $c < \inf{B} \leq b$, so $c < b$. Thus $a < c < b$ holds for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

$(c)$ Let $A = (1, 2)$ and $B = (2, 3)$. Take $c = 2$. Then for every $a \in A$ we have $a < 2$, and for every $b \in B$ we have $2 < b$, so $a < c < b$ holds for all $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. However, $\sup{A} = 2$ and $\inf{B} = 2$, so $\sup{A} \not < \inf{B}$.
