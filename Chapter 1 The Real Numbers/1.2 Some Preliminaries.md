**Exercise 1.2.7.** Given a function $f$ and a subset $A$ of its domain, let $f(A)$ represent the range of $f$ over the set $A;$ that is, $f(A) = \{f(x) : x \in A\}$.

$(a)$ Let $f(x) = x^2$. If $A = [0, 2]$ and $B = [1, 4]$, find $f(A)$ and $f(B)$. Does $f(A \cap B) = f(A) \cap f(B)$ in this case? Does $f(A \cup B) = f(A) \cup f(B)$?

$(b)$ Find two sets $A$ and $B$ for which $f(A \cap B) \ne f(A) \cap f(B)$.

$(c)$ Show that, for an arbitrary function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, it is always true the $g(A \cap B) \subseteq g(A) \cap g(B)$ for all sets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

$(d)$ Form and prove a conjecture about the relationship between $g(A \cup B)$ and $g(A) \cup g(B)$ for an arbitrary function $g$.
