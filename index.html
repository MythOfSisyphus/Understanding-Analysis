        <p>
            <i>Real Analysis</i> serves as foundation of our rigorous mathematical study, where results seem obvious and
            fairly intuitive and that's not the case when it comes to prove those results. In this course, we learn how
            to
            use axioms, definitions and theorems effectively to prove desired results.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started this course with Prof. Abbott's book <i>Understanding Analysis</i> in hand and while studying I
            came
            across well-crafted notes written by Prof. Baisheng Yan based on <i>Understanding Analysis</i> for MTH 320
            (Spring
            2018). Unfortunately, Spring 2018 version of the course isn't available online yet I found Spring 2019
            version
            that was taught by Prof. Matthew Cha and there are many homework assignments, their solutions and exams
            available for free.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm using these resources to learn <i>Real Analysis</i>. This page serves as a navigation tool to access
            materials quickly. I will be working and writing proofs of various exercises given in both book and
            assignments
            to get most out of the course and to learn proof-writing skills. If you find any mistake in a proof or much
            nicer proof of some problem, then feel free to reach out or make a pull request.
