                <strong>Introduction:</strong>
            </h2>

            <p>
                Analysis I or Real Analysis serves as foundation of our rigorous mathematical study, where results seem
                obvious and
                fairly intuitive and that's not the case when it comes to prove those results. In this course, we learn
                how to use axioms, definitions and theorems effectively to prove desired results.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started this course with Prof. Abbott's book <i>Understanding Analysis</i> in hand and while studying
                I came across Prof. Baisheng Yan's <a href="./notes/notes.html">well-crafted notes</a>
                based on <i>Understanding Analysis</i> for MTH 320 (Spring 2018).
                Unfortunately, Spring 2018 version of the course isn't available online. I managed to find Spring 2019
                version that was taught by Prof. Matthew Cha and there are many homework assignments, their solutions
                and exams available for free.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm using these resources to learn <i>Real Analysis</i>. This page serves as a navigation tool to access
                materials quickly. I will be working and writing proofs of various exercises given in both book and
                assignments
                to get most out of the course and to learn proof-writing skills. If you find any mistake in a proof or
                much
                nicer proof of some problem, then feel free to reach out or make a pull request.
            </p>
